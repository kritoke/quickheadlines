## TODO

### Minor Features/Configuration for Feeds

- Allow for a custom limit for each feed in yaml

### UI Features

- Add a search bar at the top of the page that can look through all the headlines on the feedbox page and have it go to that item immediately, having some indicator (highlight or similar).  Make it respect whichever tab it is in. 
    - Possibly have it do same thing on timeline view.
- Have a force refresh button somewhere, but rate limit it to prevent abuse.
- Add a button to clear the cache for a feed, or all feeds, but rate limit it to prevent abuse.
