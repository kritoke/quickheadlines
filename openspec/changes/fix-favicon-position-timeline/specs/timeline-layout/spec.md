## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Timeline item layout enforces inline icon alignment
The timeline's layout requirements are modified so the site icon MUST be positioned inline with the site name and vertically centered relative to the headline text. This change updates the previous layout guidance to forbid icons that visually appear above the site name when lines wrap.

#### Scenario: Wrapped headline
- **WHEN** a timeline item headline wraps to the next line at narrow widths
- **THEN** the site icon remains inline with the site name and vertically centered with the first line of the headline
