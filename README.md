# Quick Headlines
![Quick Headlines Logo](public/logo.svg)

Quick Headlines is an easily configurable and deployable recent feed dashboard.  I wanted it to be as simple as dropping an executable and a YAML file with feeds in it.  The aim is to have sane defaults, so you can get up and running quickly without fighting with it.  Making it so simple that it can just run locally as well.

## Installation

Copy the executable along with a feeds.yml file to your desired location and run it.  The example .yml included has some feeds to get you started and the default properties.  It should only require feeds, everything else should have some basic defaults to allow it to "just work."

## Usage

Run the executable for your particular platform, edit the feeds.yml file as needed.
